This project is an application that gives out gifts for Christmas, but only to names on the list of those that have behaved throughout the year (./utils/niceList.json). The catch is that on the server you are only allowed to store one 32 byte value in the server memory. This 32 byte value has to be enough for the server to be able to determine who is on the list. To accomplish this, we use a Merkle tree, Merkle proof, and verification of said Merkle proof. In this application, the client acts as the prover and the server acts as the verifier. The server takes the proof generated by the client and, using minimal information, it's able to verify that the name sent from the client is actually in the nice list.
